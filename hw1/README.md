Perm.cpp is the corrected code for problem 4, dealing with permutations of a string recursively.
Create the executable with: g++ -g -Wall perm.cpp -o perm
Run with: ./perm <no repeating characters string to permute>

Recurlists.cpp is the code for problem 5, dealing with linked lists recursively.
Create the executable with: g++ -g -Wall recurlists.cpp -o recurlists
Run with: ./recurlists <input file> <output file>

input.txt is the sample input file specified in problem 5.
input1.txt and input2.txt are test cases involving empty lists.
